## About

**Habit Tracker** is a personal productivity tool designed to help you stay accountable and build good habits. Whether you prefer working in the command line or want a user-friendly interface, this app supports both modes with a modular backend.
This project started as a CLI-based tracker and is currently being refactored into a modular, GUI-based application using Tkinter. Currently, there has not been many improvements to the structure of this program and the GUI-based application is more likely
to become a seperate project in itself due to it's file structure and complexity.

- 📊 View progress and history (in CLI)
- 💾 Data saved locally in JSON
